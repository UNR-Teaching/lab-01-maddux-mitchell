after typing ls > newfile.txt, newfile.txt was added to the file. The '>' listed all of the directories and put them in the file newfile.txt.

After running git status, it says "changes to be committed:

 (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   newfile.txt"

git diff tells you what is added or deleted from a file.
